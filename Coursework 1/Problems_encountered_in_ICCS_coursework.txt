Problems encountered
	1st iteration of development
		Only used one reading from sonar 
		If the robot hit an open ended wall it wouldn't turn sharply enough to navigate around the object and come back on course
	2nd iteration of development
		Used just one reading from the ultrasound which caused the robot to over compensate or under compensate

	3rd iteration of development
		Sonar noisy and occasionally over compensates or under compensates
			Solution to take an average of previous readings to inform the correction
		What happens when the robot hits an open ended wall or an object that juts out far from the navigating wall
			Solution needs to turn more over time when it reaches the end of the object so that it goes all the way around it

	Fine tuning turning when backing up and going around open corners that aren't 180 degrees
		Solution for backing up is to check if there were a sequence of bumps in a certain amount of time if so backup more and more


If the robot turns towards the wall the ultrasonic sensor gets further away from the wall the steeper you turn
	PID loop


When getting too close to a wall sonar reads 255 which indicates the max distance of the sensor. How can you tell that the robot is too close to the wall or going round an open corner where the next wall is greater than the max distance of the sensor


What happens when there is a hole in the bottom of an object that the robot is heading towards straight on
	Solution have lego that sticks up to the height of the robot
		If there are objects that the robot can go under it know still can
